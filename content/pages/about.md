# About Me

Welcome to my technical blog! I'm a software engineer passionate about algorithms, mathematics, and building tools that make developers' lives easier.

## What I Write About

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Deep dives into computational complexity, algorithm design, and optimization techniques
- **Mathematics**: Mathematical proofs, computational mathematics, and applications in computer science
- **Web Development**: Modern web technologies, static site generators, and developer tools
- **Systems Programming**: Low-level programming, performance optimization, and systems design

## Technical Interests

My current areas of focus include:

- High-frequency trading systems and low-latency optimization
- Machine learning and AI systems, particularly RAG implementations
- Distributed systems and cloud architecture
- Mathematical foundations of computer science

## Projects

Some of my recent projects:

1. **Custom Static Site Generator**: A lightweight, math-enabled SSG built from scratch
2. **RAG-based Chatbot**: A news aggregation platform with intelligent Q&A capabilities
3. **Algorithm Visualizer**: Interactive visualizations of sorting and graph algorithms
4. **HFT Optimization Tools**: Performance profiling and optimization utilities for trading systems

## Mathematics Corner

Here's one of my favorite mathematical identities, Euler's formula:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

This beautiful equation connects five fundamental mathematical constants:
- $e$ (Euler's number)
- $i$ (imaginary unit)
- $\pi$ (pi)
- $1$ (multiplicative identity)
- $0$ (additive identity)
